//! # Context modeling
//! 
//! The prefix tree used to encode a literal
//! byte or a distance code depends on the context ID and the block type.
//! This section specifies how to compute the context ID for a particular
//! literal and distance code, and how to encode the context map that
//! maps a <context ID, block type> pair to the index of a prefix code in
//! the array of literal and distance prefix codes.
//! 
//! ## Context modes and context ID lookup for literals
//! 
//! The context for encoding the next literal is defined by the last two
//! bytes in the stream (p1, p2, where p1 is the most recent byte),
//! regardless if these bytes are produced by backward references or by
//! literal insertions. At the start of the stream p1 and p2 are
//! initialized to zero.
//! 
//! There are four methods, called context modes, to compute the Context
//! ID:
//! * MSB6, where the Context ID is the value of six most significant bits of p1,
//! * LSB6, where the Context ID is the value of six least significant bits of p1,
//! * UTF8, where the Context ID is a complex function of p1, p2, optimized for text compression, and
//! * Signed, where Context ID is a complex function of p1, p2, optimized for compressing sequences of signed integers.
//! 
//! The Context ID for the UTF8 and Signed context modes is computed
//! using the lookup tables Lut0, Lut1, and Lut2.

/// Compute the 'Context ID' based on the last two bytes and the context mode where
/// `p1` is the most recent byte, `p2` is the second most recent byte.
///
/// Implementation based on: https://github.com/madler/brotli/blob/master/yeast.c by Mark Adler
